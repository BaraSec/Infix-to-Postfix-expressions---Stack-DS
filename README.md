# Infix to Postfix expressions - Stack DS

This was my solution to a Data Structures course's second project in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing. It's an application based on the Stack Data Structure. Its main aim is to convert infix expressions to postfix ones, with infix expression validity check, and postfix expression evaluation.

The project's description that was sent to the course's students is available at `Description/COMP242 Project2.pdf`.
